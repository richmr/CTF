# CTF Crypto
If I hand write any crypto utilities, they will be here.  Otherwise a list of resources I found useful as a I solved other crypto puzzles.

Once I hand wrote a really nice vignere solver, but I can't seem to find it anymore.  During my search I came across this package:
- sympy/crypto.py  It's standard in the Anaconda python release and appears to have solvers for a lot of the common crypto ciphers

Also found this:
- https://github.com/jameslyons/pycipher - But a quick look at the vignere solver shows it is limited to alphabetic characters.  This exact problem tripped me up in a CTF.  But still might be useful.
