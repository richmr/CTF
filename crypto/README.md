# CTF Crypto
If I hand write any crypto utilities, they will be here.  Otherwise a list of resources I found useful as a I solved other crypto puzzles.

Once I hand wrote a really nice vignere solver, but I can't seem to find it anymore.  During my search I came across this package:
- sympy/crypto.py  It's standard in the Anaconda python release and appears to have solvers for a lot of the common crypto ciphers
